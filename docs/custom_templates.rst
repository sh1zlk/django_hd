Custom Templates
================

django-helpdesk supports custom HTML templates that can be styled with CSS.

In particular, users can include a file named `helpdesk-customize.css` in their django project directory to provide CSS overrides easily.

In general, entire HTML and CSS templates may be overriden by including a file of the same name in the project directory. Django automatically searches the project directory before searching for default templates included with django-helpdesk.
